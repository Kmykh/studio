## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Grape Purple (#673AB7) to evoke the rich colors of vineyards and wine.
- Background color: Light Lavender (#F3E5F5), a desaturated tint of the primary, creates a sophisticated backdrop.
- Accent color: Muted Gold (#A1887F), an analogous hue, suggests the high value, history and tradition of fine wines.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', a modern serif similar to Didot, has an elegant, fashionable, high-end feel; the body text will use 'PT Sans' which combines a modern look and a little warmth or personality.
- Use elegant and minimalist icons related to vineyards, grapes, wine bottles, and geographical locations. Icons should be in the muted gold accent color.
- Employ a clean and structured layout that ensures easy navigation and readability. Utilize a grid system to organize vineyard entries efficiently.
- Incorporate subtle animations and transitions to enhance user engagement, such as fade-in effects or smooth scrolling. Avoid excessive or distracting animations.
